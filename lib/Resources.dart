FINDING YOUR DREAM JOB: HOW TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, A CAREER CHANGE GUIDE

1. LEAD WITH YOUR STRENGTHS
Just because you don’t know what career you want doesn’t mean you don’t know what you’re good at. A great way to focus on your skills is to make a list of your strengths. If that doesn’t come naturally to you, ask a friend or trusted co-worker their opinion. Or check out a self-analysis resource like the Myers-Briggs personality test.

Taking an active look at what you’re good at and what makes you tick personality-wise is a powerful way of assessing a career path that will fit and complement those strengths.

Of course, you can be good at anything if you try hard enough or put in enough time. But you can save a lot of time and avoid frustration if you let your strengths lead you to what you should be doing instead of forcing yourself into a career that doesn’t really fit.

For example, you might have convinced yourself (or let others convince you) that you’re not a math person, only to find out that you love using logic to solve problems.

In that case, you might actually have a passion for something like web development that you might have written off beforehand. It’s easy to let preconceived ideas stop you from a successful tech career, but, if you take some time to look at your strengths, you’ll probably be pleasantly surprised by what they tell you.


2. EVALUATE YOUR PAST TO AVOID A DEAD END
To help you clarify your feelings about previous jobs, so you can look for similar or different characteristics in the future, answer the following questions about each place you’ve worked:

What did I like most and least about the company?
What did I like most and least about the industry culture?
What did I like most and least about my boss?
What did I like most and least about the people I worked with?
What was the most challenging thing about working there?
When was I the happiest or the proudest?
What was my biggest accomplishment?
What did I like most and least about my responsibilities?

Evaluating your past can also help you recall pivotal moments you might have overlooked that would have made it clear you weren’t happy with your work. If looking back starts to uncover negative patterns around a certain kind of job or career, that’s a way to recognize that it’s time to move on.

You may very well be missing out on opportunities elsewhere that would be a much better fit with your needs and abilities. Analyzing your past is a key component to discovering the kinds of situations that will bring out your best work and happiest self.


3. TALK TO PEOPLE TO LEARN WHAT YOUR DREAM JOB IS
Start taking some time in your job search to request and schedule informational interviews with people in the fields you’re interested in to learn about their career paths and get career advice. Ask about their job, their professional past and aspirations, and the industry.

Just be sure to prepare with questions in advance so that you get the most out of these meetings or calls and, besides the no-brainer “thank you” afterward, do all you can to find a way to repay the favor.

And don’t limit yourself to people you know or have connections with. Network at conferences and workshops.

Join Twitter chats, other social media platforms, or Facebook groups. Go on LinkedIn and read people’s job descriptions or read interviews and articles about people in jobs you admire. For instance, if you’re curious about what a day in the life of a WordPress developer looks like, do a quick Google search and you’ll likely be able to find plenty of info (including a podcast or two) and people to reach out to.

Before you set your heart on a right career — or completely rule something out — make sure you get a sense of what the job is like day-to-day.

      title: 'Tips for a Successful Interview',
      content: '''Be on time.
This often means 10-15 minutes early. Interviewers often are ready before the appointment.

Know the interviewer’s name, its spelling, and pronunciation.
Use it during the interview. If you don’t know the name, call beforehand and ask the secretary. Also, note the secretary’s name in case you have to call back. Secretaries can influence the hiring decision!

Have some questions of your own prepared in advance.
There is nothing wrong with having a short list of questions and thoughts- it shows you have done your research and want to know more about the organization and the position.

Bring several copies of your resume.
Also, bring a copy of your transcript. Carry your papers in an organized manner.

Have a reliable pen and a small note pad with you.
But do not take notes during the interview. However, immediately afterward, write down as much as you can remember, including your impression of how well you did.

Greet the interviewer with a handshake and a smile.
Remember to maintain eye contact (which does not mean a stare down).

Expect to spend some time developing rapport.
Don’t jump right in and get down to business. Follow the interviewer’s lead.

Don’t be embarrassed if you are nervous.
As you gain experience you’ll become more at ease with the interviewing process.

Focus.
On your attributes, your transferable skills, and your willingness to learn; don’t apologize for a lack of experience; describe your strengths in terms of what you can do for the organization.''',

      title: '5 Tips for Overcoming Interview Anxiety',
      content: '''
1. Prepare With Mirror Work
"Stand in front of a mirror at home and talk to your reflection as if you’re in the interview responding to potential questions. 
Be aware of body language, eye contact, and rate/tone of voice. 
This helps to build self-confidence for the interview, communicate clearly, and helps to decrease anxiety. 
My clients who use this technique sometimes say they feel silly or awkward the first time they do it, 
but after practicing it they tell me how effective it can be." – Insha Rahman, LCSW

2. Research All You Can About the Company
"Don’t just read about the company profile. Read about their values, their mission statement, their aspirations, their corporate social responsibility programs etc. 
By doing that, you can relate your answers to the values that are being highlighted in the company activities. 
If you know your interviewer’s name, try to look them up on Linkedin. Check their job description and try to incorporate their action words in their job description in your answers." – Joe Wilson, Senior Employment Advisor at MintResume

3. Do a Complete Dress Rehearsal
"The week before the interview, it’s time to figure out the details. What will you wear? Try it on, make sure you’re comfortable. 
Figure out your transportation. How will you get to the interview? 
If you’re taking public transportation, do a dry run. Go to the train or bus station, figure out how crowded it is, which line is better, or which platform you need. 
If you’re driving yourself, let’s go for a drive! Drive it at the same time you plan to next week. Time how long it takes you to drive there. Find your parking, work out the kinks of your trip." – Niki Yarnot, MSW, LASW, career coach at Wanderlust Careers

4. Talk to Yourself Like You Would to a Friend
"Feeling nervous or worried before a job interview is completely normal and to be expected. It’s a high-stress situation, and you want to do your best. 
Take a deep breath. What would you say to a friend in a similar situation? 
What’s stopping you from saying and believing those things about yourself? 
How can you channel your nervous energy/anxiety into preparedness? 
Focus on the things that are within your control and practice and rehearse thoughts that you believe about yourself and the job, like, 
'I am highly qualified for this position,' or 'I am prepared to do my best in this interview.'" – Tricia Johnson, LCSW

5. Normalize the Anxiety
"Part of the reason people may struggle with anxiety before an interview isn’t necessarily because anxiety is present, but rather it’s because they’re fighting with anxiety. 
One way to stop fighting with anxiety is to 'normalize' it, which means to understand and appreciate why anxiety has a reason to be here. 
There is nothing wrong about feeling anxious before an interview. We tend to feel anxious about things we care about a lot. 
If you care a lot about your pet dog, you would likely feel anxious about losing your dog. 
If you care a lot about your favorite baseball team winning the World Series, you would likely feel anxious about your team losing. 
If we care a lot about a job, then it’s normal to feel anxious.\n\n
Even confident people will still feel anxious about a job that they really care about. The more you care, the more anxious you feel. 
The anxiety is not there to ruin your life—it is there to remind you about what is most important to you." – Dr. Brian Yu, Ph.D., CMPC, Sport-Performance Psychologist and owner of Prevail Performance Counseling PLLC.
